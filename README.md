* CarSimulator
* Connect4
* Maze
* RandomLetters
* Shapes
* SpidersWeb

Here are some example screenshots of the prototype demos running:

Here are the instructions to install the Java SDK and setup Eclipse:

1. Run the jdk-7u80-windows-x64.exe file to install the SDK
2. Extract the adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702.zip to C:\Program Files\Eclipse

To import the projects in Eclipse follow these instructions:

1. Open Eclipse
2. Select File -> Import... 
3. Choose the import source -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace
4. Select the directory of the project you want to open in the source code folder
5. Select Finish

You should now be able to choose the project in the Package Explorer and select Run to start the application.

# Note

The Connect4, RandomLetters and SpidersWeb projects should be run as Java Applets.
